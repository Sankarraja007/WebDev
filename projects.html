    <h2>1. Sudoku Solver: </h2>
    <P class="para">
        The Sudoku Solver project is a C++ application developed with the Qt framework that solves Sudoku puzzles programmatically. 
        Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. 
        This application is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels, helping users find solutions quickly and effortlessly. 
        For the application to work, the user shouldn't repeat any numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 box. After you input the numbers in their correct positions, clicking " SOLVE THE SUDOKU " will make the answer (solution grid) pop up next to the Question grid.

    <h2>2. Machine Learning Model for Rose Detection: </h2>
    <h3>Abstract: </h3>
    <p class="para">
        The primary objective of our project was to create an effective machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and quantifying the number of roses present in a given image. 
        To achieve this goal, we undertook a comprehensive workflow encompassing data acquisition, preprocessing techniques, and the implementation of a robust model for both training and inference. 
        Our approach utilized a diverse dataset of images containing various backgrounds, lighting conditions, and rose arrangements. Through meticulous preprocessing, we enhanced the dataset to improve the model's robustness. 
        The core of our project involved training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately identify and count roses within images. 
        Subsequently, our model demonstrated its capability to accurately detect and count roses during the inference phase, showcasing its potential utility in automating flower counting tasks. 
        This project contributes to the field of computer vision, providing a practical solution for floral analysis and exemplifying the broader applications of machine learning in image recognition.
